The one&#10;     exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that either party has the&#10;     right to bring an individual claim against the other in a small-claims&#10;     court of competent jurisdiction, or, if filed in arbitration, the&#10;     responding party may request that the dispute proceed in small claims&#10;     court if the party's claim is within the jurisdiction of the small claims&#10;     court. If the responding party requests to proceed in small claims court&#10;     before the appointment of the arbitrator, the arbitration shall be&#10;     administratively closed, and if requested after the appointment of the&#10;     arbitrator, the arbitrator shall determine if the dispute should be&#10;     decided in arbitration or if the arbitration should be administratively&#10;     closed and decided in small claims court.

You are entitled to a&#10;     fair hearing before the arbitrator. The arbitrator can grant any relief&#10;     that a court can, but you should note that arbitration proceedings are&#10;     usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial&#10;     proceedings. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may&#10;     be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.

Arbitration is an alternative to litigation where a&#10;     neutral person (the arbitrator) hears and decides the parties' dispute.&#10;     Arbitration proceedings are designed to provide parties with a fair&#10;     hearing in a manner that is faster and less formal than court proceedings.&#10;     The following procedures (the &#34;Arbitration Procedures&#34;) are&#10;     applicable to all arbitration proceedings involving you and </span><b><span>MEDIA COMPANY</span></b><span></span></li>&#10; <li class="MsoNormal"><u><span>Pre-Arbitration&#10;     Dispute Resolution</span></u><span>.&#10;     </span><b><span>MEDIA&#10;     COMPANY </span></b><span>is always&#10;     interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently. So before you&#10;     commence an arbitration, we suggest that you contact us to explain your&#10;     complaint, as we may be able to resolve it without the need for&#10;     arbitration. You may contact us online or at </span><span>&#160;Legal, Address&#10;     here.</span></li>&#10; <li class="MsoNormal"><u><span>Administrator</span></u><span>. The administrator for the arbitration is JAMS, an&#10;     organization that is not affiliated with PeopleMedia. JAMS facilitates,&#10;     but does not itself conduct, the arbitration. The arbitrator who will hear&#10;     and decide your dispute will be chosen from JAMS's roster of neutral&#10;     arbitrators. For information on JAMS, please visit its website,&#160;</span><span><a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank"><span>https://www.jamsadr.com/</span></a></span><span>. Information about JAMS's rules and fees for resolving&#10;     disputes can be found at JAMS's Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp;&#10;     Procedures page,&#160;</span><span><a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/" target="_blank"><span>https://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</span></a></span><span>.</span></li>&#10; <li class="MsoNormal"><u><span>Applicable Rules</span></u><span>. The arbitration will be governed by JAMS's&#10;     Streamlined Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures (the &#34;JAMS&#10;     Rules&#34;), as modified by these Arbitration Procedures. If there is any&#10;     inconsistency between the JAMS Rules and these Arbitration Procedures, the&#10;     Arbitration Procedures will control. However, if the arbitrator determines&#10;     that strict application of the Arbitration Procedures would not result in&#10;     a fundamentally fair arbitration, the arbitrator may make any order&#10;     necessary to provide a fundamentally fair arbitration that is consistent&#10;     with the JAMS Rules.</span></li>&#10; <li class="MsoNormal"><u><span>Commencing an Arbitration</span></u><span>. To commence an arbitration against PeopleMedia, you&#10;     must complete a short form, submit it to JAMS, and send a copy to&#10;     PeopleMedia at Match Legal, PO Box 25458, Dallas, TX 75225. To learn more&#10;     about commencing an arbitration and to obtain a form to institute&#10;     arbitration, please visit the JAMS website and download the form available&#10;     at:&#160;</span><span><a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf" target="_blank"><span>https://www.jamsadr.com/files/Uploads/Documents/JAMS_Arbitration_Demand.pdf</span></a></span><span>. You may represent yourself in the arbitration or have&#10;     a lawyer (or some other representative) act on your behalf. Upon receipt&#10;     of an arbitration claim, PeopleMedia may assert any counterclaims it may&#10;     have against the complaining party.</span></li>&#10; <li class="MsoNormal"><u><span>Fees</span></u><span>. You are responsible for paying your portion of the&#10;     fees set forth in the JAMS fee schedule for consumer disputes. </span><b><span>MEDIA COMPANY </span></b><span>will&#10;     pay all remaining fees. If your claim against </span><b><span>MEDIA COMPANY</span></b><span> is for less than $1,000, and you succeed on the&#10;     merits, we will pay all fees. If you believe you cannot afford the JAMS&#10;     fee, you may apply to JAMS for a fee waiver.</span></li>&#10; <li class="MsoNormal"><u><span>Discovery</span></u><span>. Each party may (a) request relevant, non-privileged&#10;     documents from the other party; and (b) request that the other party&#10;     provide the particulars of its claims or defenses. Any such discovery&#10;     requests must be served on the other party within 21 days after the&#10;     arbitrator's appointment. The responding party shall provide the&#10;     requesting party with all responsive, non-privileged documents, the&#10;     requested particulars, and/or any objections to the requests within 15&#10;     days after receipt of the requests. Any disputes about discovery or&#10;     requests for extensions shall be submitted promptly to the arbitrator for&#10;     prompt resolution. In ruling on any discovery dispute or extension&#10;     request, the arbitrator shall take into consideration the nature, amount,&#10;     and scope of the underlying arbitration claim, the cost and other effort&#10;     what would be involved in providing the requested discovery, the case&#10;     schedule, and whether the requested discovery is necessary for the&#10;     adequate preparation of a claim or defense.</span></li>&#10; <li class="MsoNormal"><u><span>Communications with the&#10;     Arbitrator</span></u><span>. Whenever communicating with&#10;     the arbitrator, the parties must include each other &#8211; for example, by&#10;     including the other party on a telephone conference call and copying the&#10;     other party on any written submissions, such as letters or emails. To the&#10;     extent practicable, conferences with the arbitrator will take place by&#10;     telephone conference call or email. Ex parte communications are not&#10;     permitted with any arbitrator.</span></li>&#10; <li class="MsoNormal"><u><span>Confidentiality</span></u><span>. Upon either party's request, the arbitrator will&#10;     issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party&#10;     disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not&#10;     be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a&#10;     proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted filing&#10;     of confidential information must be done under seal.</span></li>&#10; <li class="MsoNormal"><u><span>Arbitration Hearing</span></u><span>. The Parties agree to waive an oral Hearing and submit&#10;     the dispute to the Arbitrator for an Award based on written submissions&#10;     and other evidence as the Parties may agree, unless a party requests an&#10;     oral Hearing in writing within 10 days after the arbitrator's appointment.</span></li>&#10; <li class="MsoNormal"><u><span>Arbitration Award</span></u><span>. The arbitrator will render a written decision within&#10;     30 days after the hearing or, if no hearing was held, within 14 days after&#10;     any rebuttal or supplemental statements are due. The decision must clearly&#10;     specify the relief, if any, awarded and contain a brief statement of the&#10;     reasons for the award.</span></li>&#10;</ol>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#160;</span></p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Click&#160;</span><a href="https://www.blackpeoplemeet.com/v3/termsandconditions/archive"><span>here</span></a><span>&#160;to view previous Terms and Conditions.</span></p>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&#160;</span></p>&#10;&#10;<h3><span>&#160;</span><u><span>Dating&#10;Safety Tips</span></u></h3>&#10;&#10;<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Meeting new people is exciting, but you should always be&#10;cautious when interacting with someone you don&#8217;t know.
